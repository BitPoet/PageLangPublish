#PageLangPublish

##A ProcessWire module that allows publishing pages per language.

**_This module is still in alpha stage!_**

If a page isn't available in the requested language, a redirect
to the next available parent will be performed.

Adds buttons for publishing/unpublishing to the page tree.

Adds flags for published/unpublished status next to the
page name in the page tree. The necessary fields to hold
the icons are added to the language pages at install time.
